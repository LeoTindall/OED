# Installation #
OED supports Docker for installation, or it can be installed on any system with a recent
Node.js runtime and PostgreSQL.

Under Docker, OED is installed and administered using the `docker-compose` command. We
track the versions in the LTS Ubuntu repositories; however if you are on CentOS, Red Hat,
or OpenSUSE, you may need to find non-repository sources for this tool.

If you want to install OED so you can contribute code, see the "Development" section. If
you are setting up OED in order to gather data from power meters and display it, see the
"Production" section.

## Notes ##

### On The Terminal ###

This guide requires that you enter some commands into an operating system shell, or
terminal.

- On Windows, this is the "Command Line" (`cmd.exe`).
- On MacOS, you can use Terminal.app (the default), iTerm2, or any other terminal program.
- On Linux, your distribution will provide a terminal; it can generally be opened with
Ctrl+Shift+T or by searching for "Terminal" in your application menu.

### On Docker and Non-Free Operating Systems ###

Docker is well-supported on most free/libre operating systems, including GNU/Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Plan9.

Docker is not supported on Windows. Windows is incapable of supporting LXE containers,
the technology on which Docker is based, and Microsoft
[artifically limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/)
the use of Docker for Windows, a virtualized technology.

Docker is supported on MacOS via the [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
software, a virtualized technology. You may experience issues with the `devstart` script
which uses features that have problems on Docker for Mac to watch files for edits.

### On Docker-Compose ###

When using OED via Docker, most commands should be issued in the form:

`docker-compose run --rm web [COMMAND]`

In other words:
- `docker-compose run` - Execute a command in a Docker container managed by Docker-Compose
- `--rm` - Remove the container after executing the command
- `web` - Run the command in the `web` container (the container with Node and NPM)

Adding the `--service-ports` flag prevents Docker from segregating the container in the
network, so you can access the OED server. E.g.:

`docker-compose run --rm web src/scripts/devstart.sh`

## Development ##

### With Docker ###
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
1. Clone this repository.
1. Create a CSV file with a single column called "ip" with your meter IP addresses and copy it into the directory in which the project resides.
1. Set up Node environment and the database by running ```docker-compose run --rm web src/scripts/installOED.sh``` in the main directory.
1. Add meters from the ips.csv file with ```docker-compose run --rm web npm run addMamacMeters ips.csv```.
1. Update the meters you added with ```docker-compse run --rm web npm run updateMamacMeters```.
1. Start the app in development mode with ```docker-compose run --rm --service-ports web src/scripts/devstart.sh```.
1. Wait for the Webpack build to finish and then access the app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can log into the app with email: `test@example.com`, password: `password`.

In the future, you can fetch the latest meter readings with ```docker-compose run --rm web npm run updateMamacMeters```.

Killing the running process (ctrl+C) will stop the app. You can get rid of the Docker containers with ```docker-compose down```.

### Without Docker ###
1. Install git. It is necessary to work with the project.
1. Install Node.js. Node.js is the runtime used to execute our serverside JavaScript application.
1. Install NPM, the Node Package Manager. NPM is used to manage our JavaScript dependencies.
1. Clone this repository.
1. Run ```npm install``` in the project root directory.
1. Install PostgreSQL, start the PostgreSQL server, and connect to it via psql.
1. In psql, run ```CREATE DATABASE oed;``` to create the database.
1. Still in psql, run ```CREATE DATABASE oed_testing;``` to create a database for automated tests.
1. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following, replacing (?) with the desired information: <br>

```
OED_SERVER_PORT=?              # The port that the server should run on. 3000 is a good default choice
OED_TOKEN_SECRET=?             # Token for authentication. Generate something secure and random
OED_DB_USER=?                  # The user that should be used to connect to postgres
OED_DB_DATABASE=?              # The database you just created, so likely oed
OED_DB_TEST_DATABASE=?         # The test database you just created, so likely oed_testing
OED_DB_PASSWORD=?              # The password for your postgres user
OED_DB_HOST=?                  # The host for your postgres db, likely localhost
OED_DB_PORT=?                  # The port for your postgres db, likely 5432
OED_LOG_FILE=?                 # Path to the log file, defaults to ./log.txt
OED_MAIL_METHOD=?		   	   # Method of sending mail. Supports "gmail", "mailgun", "none". Case insensitive.
OED_MAIL_IDENT=?               # Identifier; username for gmail, domain for mailgun. Ex: user@example.com
OED_MAIL_CREDENTIAL=?		   # Credential; password for gmail, API key for mailgun.
OED_MAIL_FROM=?                # From address for email
OED_MAIL_TO=?                  # Who gets the e-mail. Ex: admin@example.com
OED_MAIL_ORG=?	               # Organization Name
```
8. Run ```npm run createdb``` to create the database schema.
1. Run `npm run addMamacMeters` to load mamac meters from an `.csv` file.
1. Run `npm run updateMamacMeters` to fetch new data for mamac meters in the database.
1. Run `npm run createUser` and follow the directions to create a new admin user.
1. Run ```npm run webpack:dev``` to create the Webpack bundle.
1. Run ```npm start``` to start the server.


## Production ##
### Installation ###
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
1. Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED.git [directory]`
1. Create a CSV file with a single column called "ip" with your meter IP addresses and copy it into the directory where the project resides. These are the IPs of Mamac meters from which this OED instance will pull data. If the site has no Mamac meters, you may skip this step.
1. Set up the environment with `docker-compose run --rm web src/scripts/installOED.sh --production` in the main directory. `--rm` here tells `docker-compose` not to keep the Docker containers it creates after the command finishes.
1. Edit ```docker-compose.yml``` to change
	1. the secret key (in `services -> web -> environment -> OED_TOKEN_SECRET`) to a random value. Keep it secret.
	1. the port (in `services -> web -> ports`) to a mapping from host to container; e.g., to host on your computer's port 80, set it to `80:3000`.
	TODO: Document convention for naming files
1. Copy ```src/scripts/updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash``` to ```/etc/cron.hourly/updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash``` and make the necessary modifications to the script. See the script for more detail.
1. Copy ```src/scripts/sendLogEmailCron.bash``` to ```/etc/cron.daily/sendLogEmailCron.bash``` and make the necessary modifications to the script. See the script for more detail.
1. Run ```chmod +x updateMamacMetersOEDCron.bash``` to make the script executable.
1. Run ```chmod +x sendLogEmailCron.bash``` to make the script executable.
1. Copy ```src/scripts/oed.service``` to ```/etc/systemd/system/oed.service``` and make the necessary modifications to the script. See the script for more detail.
1. Update your meters to get data for the first time. Refer to the Administration section below.
1. Run ```systemctl enable oed.service``` to make the service start on server boot.
1. Bring the app online with ```systemctl start oed.service```. Stop the app with ```systemctl stop oed.service```.
1. To import meters, visit the admin page and upload the CSV file.



# Administration #

## Data Storage ##

PostgreSQL stores its data in `postgres-data`. This and `node_modules` will be owned by root, becuase the user in the Docker continer is root; to uninstall the app, you need to delete them from inside the container (or as root on your own machine): ```docker-compose run --rm web rm -r postgres-data node_modules```.

You can access the PostgreSQL database through the `database` service. Given that the app is running, you can:

* Get a Postgres shell with `docker-compose exec database psql -U oed`
* Take a database dump with `docker-compose exec database pg_dump -U oed > dump_$(date +%Y-%m-%d"_"%H_%M_%S.sql)`
* Restore a database dump by first copying the dump into the container with `docker cp /path/to/dump.sql container_name:/dump.sql` and then restoring it into the database with `docker-compose exec database psql -U oed -f /dump.sql`.
* Change an admin's password with `docker-compose run --rm web npm run editUser` and follow the directions.

### NPM Scripts ###

These can be run by executing `npm run [SCRIPT]` in the `web` Docker-Compose service
(e.g. `docker-compose run --rm web npm run [SCRIPT] [args]`).

For non-Docker installs, simply issue `npm run [SCRIPT]`.

App actions:
* `start` starts the NodeJS webserver.
* `start:dev` starts the NodeJS webserver with Nodemon, so it restarts automatically.
* `webpack:dev` runs Webpack in development mode and dynamically rebuilding the client-side application when files change.
* `webpack:build` runs Webpack once in production mode.
* `webpack` runs Webpack once in development mode.

Validation and CI actions:
* `check` runs all the below non-test checks (that is, all static checks)
* `check:header` ensures that there are no source files without MPL headers.
* `check:typescript` ensures that there are no JavaScript source files in the TypeScript portion of the project.
* `check:lint` runs TSLint against the project to ensure style conformity.
* `check:types` runs the TypeScript compiler without emitting code (i.e. just checks for type errors).
* `test` runs the automated test suite on the server.

Administration:
* `createdb` creates the database schema in an uninitialized database. It will not update the schema.
* `addMamacMeters` adds meters from a CSV file (see above).
* `updateMamacMeters` fetches new data from previously imported Mamac meters.
* `createUser` creates a new user. If given no arguments, it is interactive; you can also pass the username and password as command line arguments.
* `editUser` edits the password of an existing user.

### Upgrading the App ###

To upgrade the app:
1. Stop the app (`systemctl stop oed.service`)
1. Store your local config changes with `git stash`
1. Update with `git pull`.
1. Replace your local changes with `git stash pop`
1. Re-build the app (`docker-compose run --rm web ./src/scripts/updateOED.sh`)
1. Restart the app (`systemctl start oed.service`)
